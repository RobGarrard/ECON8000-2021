%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item (2 points) Prove by induction that the sum of the first $n$ odd numbers is $n^{2}$.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item (2 points) Show that the intersection of any number of closed sets is closed.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item (2 points) Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space and $\{x_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be a sequence. Suppose $x_{n} \to a$ and $x_{n} \to b$. Show that $a=b$. That is, a sequence can converge to at most one point.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item (3 points)  For each of the following matrices, state the dimensions of the column and null spaces.

\begin{multicols}{3}
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item $\begin{pmatrix}1 &0 &0 &1 \\ 0 &2 &3& 3 \\ 0& 0 & 1 & 5 \end{pmatrix}$

\item $\begin{pmatrix}0 &0 &0 &0 \\ 0 &0 &0& 0 \\ 0& 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$

\item $\begin{pmatrix}1 &0 &1 \\ 0 &1 & 0 \\ 1& 1 & 1 \\ 2 & 2 & 2  \end{pmatrix}$

\end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\item (3 points) Let $A = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 &  0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1\end{pmatrix}$.
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
	\item Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $A$. [2 points]
	\item Can $A$ be diagonalized? If yes, verify that $A = P^{-1}DP$; if no, state why. [1 point]
\end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item (2 points) Let $X \sim N(0, 1)$ and $Y \sim N(0, 1)$, $X$ and $Y$ independent. Suppose I want to generate another standard normal variable, $Z \sim N(0, 1)$, such that $\mathrm{Cov}(X, Z) = \rho$ for some arbitrary $\rho\in [-1, 1]$. Find constants $a$ and $b$ such that the linear combination $Z = aX + bY$ yields such a variable.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\item (2 points) Let $(X, d)$ be a complete metric space. Let $f:X \to X$ be a contraction mapping, such that $\forall x,y\in X \ d(f(x), f(y)) \leq M d(x,y)$, $0 \leq M < 1$. Show that the sequnce formed by iterating the function starting from an arbitrary point $x_{0}\in X$, $x_{n} = f(x_{n-1})$ for $n \geq 1$, is a Cauchy sequence.
